**DJS06 Project Brief: Higher Order Functions**

**INTRODUCTION**
This project is designed to challenge and deepen your understanding of JavaScript's powerful array methods. You'll manipulate data using `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and more, to perform a variety of tasks. This exercise will test your ability to apply these methods in combination to solve complex problems and achieve desired outcomes.

**South African Data Analysis**
This script provides functionality to analyze various datasets related to South Africa, including lists of provinces, names, products, and people. It performs operations such as logging, transformation, sorting, filtering, and mapping on the datasets.

***Provinces***
The script contains an array provinces listing the provinces of South Africa.
***Names***
An array names contains a list of names.
***Products***
The products array contains objects with product names and prices.
***People***
The people array consists of objects representing individuals with their names and provinces.
***Operations***
Logs each person's name with their respective province in the format "Name (Province)".Transforms province names to uppercase and logs them.Calculates and logs the lengths of each name.Sorts provinces alphabetically and logs the sorted list.Filters out provinces containing the term "Cape" and logs the remaining provinces.Searches for names containing the letter 'S' and logs the results.Creates a mapping of names to provinces and logs the resulting object.

**FOR ADVANCE ONE**


**Product Analysis and Manipulation**
This script analyzes and manipulates a list of products with prices. It performs various operations such as logging, filtering, mapping, and transformation on the product data.

***Product Data***
The script contains an array products with objects representing different products along with their prices.

***Operations***
 Logs the names of all products, separated by commas.Filters products to retrieve those with names containing five characters or fewer.Filters out products with empty prices, converts prices to numbers, and calculates the total price of all products.Concatenates all product names into a single string.Determines the products with the highest and lowest prices and formats them into a string.Transforms the product array into a new array of objects with keys 'name' and 'cost'.
